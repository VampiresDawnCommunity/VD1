# Vampires Dawn: Community Edition

*Vampires Dawn: Community Edition* is a collaborative project that aims to modernize the antiquated code base of the classic German **RM2K** game ***Vampires Dawn*** and to integrate a wide variety of mods created over the last several years by a multitude of creators & developers.

The original game was created by **Alexander “Marlex” Koch** and used the unofficial English translation of the **RPG Maker 2000** engine.
This refactor of the game is based on the tools & player engine provided by the [EasyRPG](https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player) project and uses several new features that were introduced in the official English (Steam) translation of **RPG Maker 2000**, extended event commands from the later **RPG Maker 2003** release (and its own official Steam translation), as well as custom commands from the **Maniac Patch** by **BingShan** and the translation tool ***lcftrans*** by the **EasyRPG** project.
